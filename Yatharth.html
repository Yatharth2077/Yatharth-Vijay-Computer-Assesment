        <div class=a>The Taste of Mizoram</div>
       <h3 style="background-color:rgb(0, 177, 247);">Mizoram is a state in northeastern India, with Aizawl as its seat of government and capital city. The name of the state is derived from "Mizo", the self described name of the native inhabitants, and "Ram", which in the Mizo language means "land." Thus "Mizo-ram" means "land of the Mizos". Within India's northeast region, it is the southernmost landlocked state, sharing borders with three of the Seven Sister States, namely Tripura, Assam and Manipur. The state also shares a 722-kilometre (449 mi) border with the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Myanmar.</h3>
